You are an expert meeting analyst. I will give you the full transcript of a meeting. 
Your task: Extract ONLY the key insights, conclusions, and reasoning. Do not write introductions, summaries, or filler like "the meeting discussed...". 
Be specific, concise, and insightful. 

Output format:
1. Organize as a hierarchy with 2–4 main categories.
2. Under each category, list subpoints and supporting details.
3. Avoid repeating phrases from the transcript unless they are critical terminology.
4. Remove small talk, repeated points, and irrelevant remarks.
5. Keep every bullet point as a standalone fact or actionable idea.
6. If a topic has causes, impacts, and solutions, break them into separate subpoints.
7. Use neutral, objective wording — no opinions or interpretations beyond what is clearly stated.
8. Output in this exact structure:

Main Topic A
    ├─ Subtopic 1
    │    ├─ Insight / Fact
    │    └─ Insight / Fact
    └─ Subtopic 2
         ├─ Insight / Fact
         └─ Insight / Fact
Main Topic B
    ├─ Subtopic 1
    └─ Subtopic 2

After generating the hierarchy, also provide a JSON version in this format:
{
  "Main Topic A": {
    "Subtopic 1": ["Insight", "Insight"],
    "Subtopic 2": ["Insight", "Insight"]
  },
  "Main Topic B": {
    "Subtopic 1": ["Insight"],
    "Subtopic 2": ["Insight"]
  }
}
